# Resources

Resources are entities that contain information about datasets.

## Overview

A list of resources can be accessed by clicking on the 'Resources / Files' link in the main menu on the left hand side of the Lintol interface. Each resource summarises the following information:

- Resource Name
- File Type
- Source
- Date Added
- Owner
- Status - (Uploaded, No Profile, Profile Run, Report Available, New Validations)

Further details about a resource can be viewed by clicking on the 'View Resource' link on the right of a resource entry. This will display an expanded panel with information about reports that have been produced from the resource and data profiles to which the resource is linked.

## Sorting and Filtering

The list of resources can be refined by selecting an option from one or more of the filter dropdown lists at the top of the list. Once an option has been selected it will automatically refine the list to resources which apply to the filtered options. The list can also be refined by entering a search term into the text input at the top of the list. As a search term is typed, the list will be refined automatically to resources in which the name contains the search term.

The list of resources can be sorted by clicking on the header of each column in the list. The first click of header will order the list by that column in ascending order. If the the same column is clicked a second time, the list will be ordered by that column but in descending order. Columns will order alphabetically for text based columns, numerically for number based columns and in date order for columns containing dates.


## Add a Resource

There are a number of ways to add a resource to Lintol. A resource can be added by clicking one of the links at the top of the resources list. When a resource is added to Lintol it creates a reference to a dataset. If the reference to the dataset becomes broken or the dataset becomes unavailable Lintol will highlight this issue in the list of resources.

### Add from URL

Clicking on the 'Add by URL' link will open a modal popup. One or more URLs can be added by typing or copying and pasting into the text input. Each URL should be placed on a new line. A resource will be added for each URL that is submitted when clicking on the submit button.

### Add via File Upload

If the user is authenticated with CKAN, clicking on the 'Upload your Files' link will redirect the user to their CKAN dataset upload page. If the user is authenticated with Github, clicking on the 'Upload your Files' link will redirect the user to their Github repositories page.

Uploading a file to the associated platform will automatically populate the datasets into the Lintol "Resources / Files" section.
