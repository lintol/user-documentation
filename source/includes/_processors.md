# Data Processors

Data Processors are the entities that run the validation on the data. A data processor is handed to the job queue along with the data that is going to be validated. Each job then knows which data processor or processors have to be used to validate the data.

## Overview
A list of data processors can be accessed by clicking on the 'Data Processors' link in the main menu on the left hand side of the Lintol interface. Each data processor summarises the following information in the list:

- Name
- Description
- Created date
- Last updated date
- Unique reference
- Implentations - number of times the processor has been added to a data profile

<!--More details about an individual data processor can be viewed by clicking on the data processor entry in the list.-->

## Searching

The list of data processors can be refined by entering a search term into the text input at the top of the data processors list. As a search term is typed, the list will be refined automatically to data processors in which the name or description contains the search term.
