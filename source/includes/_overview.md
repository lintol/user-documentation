# Infrastructure

## Components
The infrastructure for Lintol has a number of different components. Each of these components are hosted within a linux server environment. There are a numerous ways of hosting the linux environments required for Lintol. This documentation records and explains the infrastructure used by the Lintol development team.

* AWS EC2 - compute resources
* AWS Route 53 - DNS management
* AWS S3 - data storage
* Kubernetes - container cluster
* Traefik - routing and load balancing


## Deployment Tools
Deploying the Lintol infrastructure on the components referenced in the Components section requires a number of deployment and configuration tools.

* AWS CLI
* KubeCtl
* Kops
* Helm - prerequisites [Composer, Docker]

## Front-end

The Lintol front-end UI is the web interface component for Lintol. It provides a web portal for using Lintol's other components. It is Javascript based project that uses Vue templates to render a single page application connected to the Lintol Capstone backend.

### Front-end Deployment
Doorstep requires npm (node packet manager) to install the project dependencies. Here are the steps to run the front-end UI as a standalone process for development, production and testing.

```shell
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

#build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

## Doorstep

Doorstep is a CLI component of Lintol that runs the validation processors against the data provided. It can be operated via the command line as a standalone process or be integrated with the Lintol UI and Capstone components to provide a fully featured web application.

Doorstep creates data validation jobs by combining a data source with a validation script in a virtual environment that can be run in a single or multi threaded process. Standalone Doorstep will receive parameters for the script and data source and run a job in single threaded process.

Doorstep requires Python 3.4 or higher, geos package and virtualenv which can be installed using pip3. Here are the steps to run Doorstep as a standalone process from the command line.

###Doorstep Deployment

#### OSX prerequisites
```shell
brew install python3
brew install geos
pip3 install virtualenv
```

#### Linux prerequisites
```shell
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-venv libgeos libgeos-dev python3-pip
```

#### Get and run Doorstep
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lintol/doorstep
cd doorstep
pip3 install -U setuptools
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
python3 setup.py develop
ltldoorstep process --engine dask.threaded example/data/protected_wrecks.geojson example/processors/boundary_checker_impr.py
