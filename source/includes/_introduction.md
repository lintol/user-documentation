# Introduction

Welcome to the Lintol Documentation! You can use the documentation to reference the functionality that Lintol provides.

Lintol is a collection of components that work together to provide data validation and analytics services for open data. It was designed to work in conjunction with the CKAN platform.

Datasets that are uploaded to a CKAN instance can use the Lintol extension to automatically run various validation processes on the data. This will improve the quality, speed and cost-effectiveness of data publishing. Lintol components are web-based and are configured and managed through the Lintol web application.
